# Version Control Systems

**Version Control Systems** (**VCS**) are the systems that allow management of changes to the files, pages and code. They allow people to work on projects in a collaborative manner, where several people are allowed to make changes to a distributed artifact. Updates to the files are also distributed among people.

The most evident benefit is that **VCS** allows seamless collaboration betweem team members

## Types of VCS

- **Centralized VCS**. In centralized VCS, the management of the repository is the task of one centralized entity, which grants access to other users for read, modification of the project
- **Decentralized VCS**. In decentralized VCS, all users are allowed to manage the full clone of the repositoty (its history, etc). It allows more flexibility, as well as introduces additional layers of complexity

## Popular Version Control Systems

- **Git**. The most widely adopted vesrsion control system. It makes a full clone of the repository to the local machine, which allows users to work on the project online, and synchronize their progress with the online repository on demand.
- **Subversion**. A centralized version control system. Manages accesses of the user to concrete files, and versions them under the hood. Used to track file changes over time.
- **Mercurial**. Another example of distributed Version Control System. Its main focus, however is the simplicity of performing operations on it.
