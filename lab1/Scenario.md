# DevOps Scenario

Imagine we have a development team of a small startup with little to no experience. They have the product, with a coding base which has no tests but at least deployment is automated They encounter their first problem: Users report their services are not working and display cryptic messages of errors. To solve the problem, the team of developers could adopt several DevOps techniques, such as:

- **Automated dashboards and monitoring tools** - to detect in advance the problems with the product and not get message for users next time. Monitoring tools could send alerts that something is wrong with production. Following the practice decreases the reaction time and potential reputation-related issues.
- **Continuous testing** - to prevent some problems from even happening. Detecting errors in test time rather than on production server would increase the quality of services.
- **Continuous integration** - would help automate the testing procedures and make life of software developers much easier.
