# DevOps list of practices
 
1. **Continuous planning**
    Continious planning is a shift from annual monthly, or yearly plans in strategic decisions about product to a more shorter and flexible plans that are discussed regularly. This helps teams to react to changing circumstances properly and in time. For example, we have a team of software developers, who has regular meetings about planning every 2-3 weeks. This sprint the team decides to implement a new business feature, which would require several sprints to fully develop. Then, during the sprint an emergency regulations come from the government that could not possibly wait and would need some refactoring in the project. The next sprint, the team revises their plans to implement a new business feature and takes the governmental task with high priority.
2. **Automated dashboards and monitoring tools**
   Metrics monitoring and automated dashboards are required to monitor the healthiness of the applications and services, deployed at the production. They help identify the occurrences of failures in the infrastructure so that developers could fix them.
3. **Continuous feedback loop**
   Software development teams need to analyze the success of their work. For such purposes, DevOps team could measure several metrics to identify the quality of the services.
4. **Continuous integration**
    Continious integration is a technique, when developers actively push their changes to the remote repository, where all the testing and building happens automatically. This saves a lot of time to check if changes valid, and to build images for the developers. For example, we can use github actions to build testing and building pipelines, so that developers would not have to do it manually.
5. **Continuous release**
   Continious delivery of the value to the end-user. The main benefit of the practice is that we let the users incrementally use new functionality and provide fixes for the bugs, security issues, etc. As an example, for the week the developers have fixed vulnerabilities and implemented a new feature. By the end of the week the following functionalities were on the production environment available to users.
6. **Continious testing**
   Continious testing of features provides quality assurance of the project. Testing could identify bugs before they appear in prod. Moreover, it also guarantees the reliability of the pieces of code that would be refactored. Changing existing code may break some existing tests.
