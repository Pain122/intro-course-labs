## Task 1

The first thing I did, I created a folder in the repository:

![Image1](images/step1.png)

Then, I pushed chages to my repo into lab9 branch and created PR to my main. I could not obviously start pipelines from the upstream:

After that, I went to the actions page in my repo, and got to the explore page:

### Key concepts

1. GitHub Actions - GitHub solution for running pipelines
2. Workflow - configurable process to automate running jobs on your reposibory
3. Job - set of steps which are needed to be completed fully for a step to be considered completed
4. Step - a single atomic building block to build pipelines
5. Runner - a machine that is going to run steps and jobs of the pipeline
6. Artifact - some files that could be produced by pipelines for later use
