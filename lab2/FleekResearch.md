# Fleek research

## Steps to deploy
  - I forked the project repository, so that I could finish labs
  - Then, I opened the web site https://app.fleek.co/
  - Next, I had to sign in to the site
  - After that, I added fleek the rights to view my fork
  - Lastly, I chose to deploy it to IPFS
## Custom configuration 
  Custom settings are not applicable to the project
## Links
- IPFS link: https://fleek.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcGd6GAASJaEHtuip4WwiWyaCoowkpVJx5jWfBSTV542g/
- Custom link: billowing-bar-9589.on.fleek.co
## Observations
Whilst we did not have to provide custom configurations, it was good to see fleek supports adding specific docker images, and setting environmental variables
