# Software Distribution

Software distribution is a process of sharing and distributing the software from companies to the end users, as well as ensuring the latest and stable verisons are provided. 

## Different strategies
- Physical media distribution: Distribution of the software through physical media (discs, cartriges). Mostly obsolete nowadays, with the exception of gaming industry (consoles still use disks or other proprietary formats)
- Online download from sites: Just, coming to the website of the company and download their software, i.e. WinRar
- App Stores: Distribution of software in centralized application store. App Store for IOS, Google Play Store are the most obvious examples
- Package Managers: yum, pip, apt, npm. Designed to be called from terminal (for smart people)
- Cloud-based Deployment: AWS. Instead of tasking the user with downloading new version, we could update it on our cloud based solutions for everyone
- Containers: Distribure application through the built containers, that correspond to a particular standart. If your OS supports such standart, a plethora of containers are available for you to deploy. Example - Docker
- Freeware. It is free for a limited amount of time and then asks to buy it or else it won't work. In case of WinRar it only asks for money 

## Best practices
- Version control. Manage the updates for the software and provide adequate means of updating software. Comes free of charge in App Stores, as they have native integrations of versions updates
- User Feedback and analytics. Gather feedback to gain insights on how to improve the application. Comments in App Store
- Security measures. Implementing Secure means to transfer applications updates to the end user. App Stores come with this feature already working
